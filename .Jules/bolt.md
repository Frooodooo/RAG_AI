## 2024-05-22 - Memoization in Chat Lists
**Learning:** In a chat application where the parent component manages a high-frequency "typing" or "loading" state (e.g., updating a timer every second), failing to memoize the message list items (`ChatMessage`) causes the entire history to re-render on every tick. This is a critical performance bottleneck when messages involve expensive operations like Markdown parsing.
**Action:** Always wrap `ChatMessage` components in `React.memo` when the parent component has frequent state updates that don't affect individual messages.

## 2024-05-23 - Array filtering in React Renders
**Learning:** Performing `Array.prototype.filter` coupled with string manipulations like `.toLowerCase()` on every single React render pass is a hidden `O(N)` cost that scales poorly with user data (like chat history). Even if `N` is relatively small, unnecessary repeated operations block the main thread unnecessarily.
**Action:** Always wrap list filtering logic that relies on component state (e.g., a search string) inside `useMemo`, and hoist expensive invariant calculations (like `.toLowerCase()` on the search string) outside of the iterator callbacks.

## 2024-05-24 - Cascading Re-renders in React Polling Hooks
**Learning:** When a custom hook polls an external API (like n8n execution status) and calls `setState` with structurally equivalent but referentially distinct objects (e.g., new `Set` instances for done/error nodes), it bypasses React's default equality checks. This forces the entire consumer component tree (e.g., `WorkflowVisualizer`) to re-render on every poll interval, severely degrading frontend performance.
**Action:** In React polling hooks, implement structural equality checks (e.g., deep comparing `Set` items using a helper) before executing `setState` to prevent unnecessary state updates from failing React's equality checks and causing cascading re-renders.

## 2025-03-15 - React.lazy Code Splitting for Heavy Chart Libraries
**Learning:** Graphing/Chart libraries like `@xyflow/react` can dramatically increase the main bundle size (e.g., adding ~185KB min+gzip) and trigger chunk size warnings, severely slowing down initial page loads even if the chart tab is not the default view.
**Action:** When code-splitting a heavy dependency using `React.lazy`, split at the boundary of the highest-level component that consumes it (e.g., `App.tsx` importing `WorkflowVisualizer`). Attempting to split individual sub-components within a file that still synchronously imports library hooks will defeat the code splitting.
