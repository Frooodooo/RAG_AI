## 2024-05-22 - Memoization in Chat Lists
**Learning:** In a chat application where the parent component manages a high-frequency "typing" or "loading" state (e.g., updating a timer every second), failing to memoize the message list items (`ChatMessage`) causes the entire history to re-render on every tick. This is a critical performance bottleneck when messages involve expensive operations like Markdown parsing.
**Action:** Always wrap `ChatMessage` components in `React.memo` when the parent component has frequent state updates that don't affect individual messages.
